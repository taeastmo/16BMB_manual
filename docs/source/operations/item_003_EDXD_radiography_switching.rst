EDXD and radiography mode switching
-----------------------------------
| There are currently three modes of operation:
   1. EDXD with direct (collimated) beam
   2. EDXD with condensed beam beam
   3. Radiography imaging with direct beam





| Setup of slits and filter for EDXD and radiography measurement.
| Open :guilabel:`Slits/Filter Setup` on the PEC user interface.

Input slit sizes and filter setup values in the 'Preset Position' window. 

.. warning:: Please do not change other parameters (e.g., Tip X, Y, Z, and so on).

   

Setup 1 is for EDXD measurements and setup 2 is for radiography measurement. Filter value 
is typically 0 (no filter) for EDXD measurement and -45 (100 Î¼m molybdenum) for 
radiography measurement. Please close the window after completion.
'1-st Hsize', '1-st Vsize', '2-nd Hsize', '2-nd Vsize', 'Filter' setups change 
simultaneously by clicking :guilabel:`Slit for EDXD` (EDXD) or :guilabel:`For Camera` (radiography).
