Data transfer tips
==================

Understand the data transfer and sync is one-way (source to target).

* Two options (ask your local contact to setup):

   * Upload the data all at once after completing the experiment
   * Real time data upload and sync
   
* During the real time upload and sync, creation of new folders and files, 
  and modification of the existing ones at source will be synced real-time 
  (with some latency depending on internet traffic).

* Deletion of exiting ones, however, cannot be synced and may mess up the 
  folder trees at Globus endpoint. Use real-time sync with a caution.
