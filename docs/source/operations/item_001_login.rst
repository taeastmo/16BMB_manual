This login id and password will be required when re-logging in the computers (e.g., after rebooting the operating system), and can be provided by the beamline staff.

There are three computers provided at the beamline:

1. Beamline control computer 
2. Data analysis computer
3. Beamline public network computer

The beamline control machine is a windows computer from which the beamline controls will be accessed to run the experiment, while the data analysis computer has various software 
programs installed and can be used, where feasible, for analysis of recently acquired data to better inform experimental decisions. Please discuss any software needs with the beamline 
staff if you need a preferred software installed at the beamline. The beamline control and data analysis machines are on a private network, i.e., they do not have access to the internet.
If you need to access the internet for any reason, please use the beamline public network computer or a personal device.
