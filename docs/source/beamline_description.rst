Beamline description
====================

The HPCAT 16-BM-B beamline is dedicated to white beam x-ray diffraction and radiography 
research of materials under high pressure.

With the APS bending magnet white x-rays (5-120 keV), the multi-angle energy 
dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXD) technique is extensively utilized to obtain 
structure factors up to Q=around 20 Ã…\ :sup:`-1`. A Paris-Edinburgh Cell (PEC) 
(250 ton capability) is equipped for samples requiring a large scattering volume, 
especially for studies of high-temperature melt and amorphous structure. The range of 
pressure and temperature is up to 7 GPa and 2300K. The PEC setup includes a white 
beam radiography system, which allows the structure measurement with EDXD to be 
combined with radiographic volumetry, ultrasonic sound velocity measurement and/or 
falling sphere viscosity measurement.
